### üìä **Collateral Usage Analysis** ‚≠ê NEW!

#### Understanding Collateral Management
The dashboard now provides comprehensive collateral usage analysis to help you manage your put option risk exposure effectively.

#### Key Metrics Displayed
- **Total Collateral**: Sum of all put option collateral requirements
- **Total Account Value**: Your IBKR account's net liquidation value
- **Collateral Percentage**: What percentage of your account is tied up as collateral
- **Available Capital**: Remaining capital not committed to collateral

#### Visual Risk Indicators
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of collateral usage
- **Color-Coded Alerts**:
  - üü¢ **Green (< 30%)**: Healthy usage - room for additional positions
  - üü° **Yellow (30-50%)**: Moderate usage - monitor closely
  - üî¥ **Red (> 50%)**: High usage - consider reducing positions

#### Smart Recommendations
The system provides dynamic recommendations based on your collateral usage:
- **Low Usage (< 30%)**: "Healthy collateral usage - Room for additional positions"
- **Moderate Usage (30-50%)**: "Moderate collateral usage - Monitor closely"
- **High Usage (> 50%)**: "High collateral usage - Consider reducing position sizes"

#### Risk Management Benefits
- **Prevent Over-Leveraging**: Avoid tying up too much capital in collateral
- **Optimize Position Sizing**: Balance returns with risk exposure
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track collateral usage as positions change
- **Account Integration**: Uses actual IBKR account values for accuracy

#### How It Works
1. **Account Value**: Fetches net liquidation value from IBKR account ledger
2. **Collateral Calculation**: Sums up all put option collateral from position analysis
3. **Percentage Calculation**: Divides collateral by account value
4. **Risk Assessment**: Applies thresholds to determine risk level
5. **Visual Display**: Shows metrics with color-coded progress indicators

### üî¨ **Enhanced Risk Analytics Usage** ‚≠ê NEW!

#### Understanding the Greeks
- **Delta (-0.5 to 0)**: How much your put position value changes with stock price
  - Delta = -0.8: Position gains $0.80 for every $1 stock drop
  - Delta = -0.2: Position gains $0.20 for every $1 stock drop
- **Gamma (0 to 0.05+)**: How quickly delta changes (acceleration risk)
  - High gamma (>0.02): Delta changes rapidly with stock moves
  - Low gamma (<0.01): Delta changes slowly
- **Theta (negative)**: Daily time decay (value lost per day)
  - Theta = -0.1: Position loses $0.10 per day from time decay
- **Vega (0 to 0.2+)**: Sensitivity to volatility changes
  - High vega: Position value changes significantly with volatility

#### Interpreting Risk Levels
- **High Risk**: Delta > 0.7, Gamma > 0.02, or Theta < -0.1
- **Medium Risk**: Delta 0.5-0.7, Gamma 0.01-0.02, or Theta -0.05 to -0.1
- **Low Risk**: Delta < 0.5, Gamma < 0.01, and Theta > -0.05

#### Stress Testing Scenarios
- **Stock Drop 10%**: Shows P&L impact of moderate market decline
- **Stock Drop 20%**: Shows P&L impact of significant market decline
- **Volatility +50%**: Shows impact of market volatility spike
- **Time Decay (1 week)**: Shows value erosion over 7 days
- **Gamma Risk**: Shows impact of large, rapid price moves

#### Portfolio Risk Management
- **Total Delta**: Portfolio sensitivity to overall market direction
- **Total Gamma**: Portfolio acceleration risk from large moves
- **Total Theta**: Daily time decay across all positions
- **Total Vega**: Portfolio volatility exposure
- **High Risk Positions**: Count of positions requiring close attention

#### Stock Concentration Analysis ‚≠ê NEW!

##### Understanding Concentration Risk
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Shows what percentage of your put collateral is allocated to each stock
- **Concentration Thresholds**:
  - **High Risk (>25%)**: Significant concentration requiring immediate attention
  - **Medium Risk (15-25%)**: Moderate concentration to monitor closely
  - **Low Risk (<15%)**: Well-diversified allocation
- **Over-Investment Alert**: Stocks with >20% allocation are flagged for review

##### Key Metrics
- **Total Stocks**: Number of different stocks in your put portfolio
- **Max Concentration**: Highest percentage allocated to any single stock
- **Average Concentration**: Mean allocation across all stocks
- **High Concentration Count**: Number of stocks with >25% allocation

#### Real Stock Price Integration ‚≠ê NEW!

##### Accurate ITM Detection
- **Live Market Data**: Real-time stock prices from IBKR market data feeds
- **Precise ITM Calculation**: Accurate detection of in-the-money put positions
- **Assignment Risk Assessment**: Realistic assignment probability based on actual stock prices
- **Greeks Accuracy**: More precise option Greeks calculations using real underlying prices

##### How It Works
1. **Symbol Search**: IBKR API searches for stock symbols to get contract IDs
2. **Market Data Snapshot**: Real-time price data fetched for each stock
3. **Price Extraction**: Current price extracted from IBKR quote data
4. **ITM Analysis**: Stock price compared to put strike for accurate ITM detection
5. **Greeks Calculation**: Real stock price used in Black-Scholes calculations

- **Better Risk Assessment**: More accurate assignment risk calculations
- **Improved Greeks**: More precise delta, gamma, theta, and vega values
- **Market-Aware Analysis**: ITM status reflects actual market conditions

##### Fallback Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: If stock price unavailable, Greeks use default values
- **Clear Indicators**: UI shows "N/A" when real prices not available
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting price fetch issues
- **Partial Analysis**: ITM analysis only shows positions with real price data
