### üî¨ **Enhanced Risk Analytics Usage** ‚≠ê NEW!

#### Understanding the Greeks
- **Delta (-0.5 to 0)**: How much your put position value changes with stock price
  - Delta = -0.8: Position gains $0.80 for every $1 stock drop
  - Delta = -0.2: Position gains $0.20 for every $1 stock drop
- **Gamma (0 to 0.05+)**: How quickly delta changes (acceleration risk)
  - High gamma (>0.02): Delta changes rapidly with stock moves
  - Low gamma (<0.01): Delta changes slowly
- **Theta (negative)**: Daily time decay (value lost per day)
  - Theta = -0.1: Position loses $0.10 per day from time decay
- **Vega (0 to 0.2+)**: Sensitivity to volatility changes
  - High vega: Position value changes significantly with volatility

#### Interpreting Risk Levels
- **High Risk**: Delta > 0.7, Gamma > 0.02, or Theta < -0.1
- **Medium Risk**: Delta 0.5-0.7, Gamma 0.01-0.02, or Theta -0.05 to -0.1
- **Low Risk**: Delta < 0.5, Gamma < 0.01, and Theta > -0.05

#### Stress Testing Scenarios
- **Stock Drop 10%**: Shows P&L impact of moderate market decline
- **Stock Drop 20%**: Shows P&L impact of significant market decline
- **Volatility +50%**: Shows impact of market volatility spike
- **Time Decay (1 week)**: Shows value erosion over 7 days
- **Gamma Risk**: Shows impact of large, rapid price moves

#### Portfolio Risk Management
- **Total Delta**: Portfolio sensitivity to overall market direction
- **Total Gamma**: Portfolio acceleration risk from large moves
- **Total Theta**: Daily time decay across all positions
- **Total Vega**: Portfolio volatility exposure
- **High Risk Positions**: Count of positions requiring close attention

#### Stock Concentration Analysis ‚≠ê NEW!

##### Understanding Concentration Risk
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Shows what percentage of your put collateral is allocated to each stock
- **Concentration Thresholds**:
  - **High Risk (>25%)**: Significant concentration requiring immediate attention
  - **Medium Risk (15-25%)**: Moderate concentration to monitor closely
  - **Low Risk (<15%)**: Well-diversified allocation
- **Over-Investment Alert**: Stocks with >20% allocation are flagged for review

##### Key Metrics
- **Total Stocks**: Number of different stocks in your put portfolio
- **Max Concentration**: Highest percentage allocated to any single stock
- **Average Concentration**: Mean allocation percentage across all stocks
- **High Risk Stocks**: Count of stocks with >25% concentration

##### Risk Management Recommendations
- **Diversification**: Aim to keep no single stock above 20% of portfolio
- **Concentration Limits**: Consider reducing positions in stocks >25% allocation
- **Regular Monitoring**: Check concentration levels weekly or after new positions
- **Balanced Approach**: Spread risk across multiple stocks and sectors

##### Using the Concentration Table
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of allocation percentages
- **Color Coding**: Red (high risk), Yellow (medium risk), Green (low risk)
- **Stock Analytics**: Average returns, total P&L, and position counts per stock
- **Risk Level Badges**: Quick identification of concentration risk levels
- **Status Indicators**: "Over-Invested" vs "Balanced" status for each stock
